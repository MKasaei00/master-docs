# Sketch-Based Anomaly Detection in Streaming Graphs

This article is the base article I have worked on.

My proposal is about edge anomaly detection in streaming graphs

It has 4 datasets but the datasets have very high AUC (> 90%) and it is hard to push the limits

So I try to find the articles and datasets that are not related to intrusion detection
