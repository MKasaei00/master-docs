## Review & compare on works

Since I have analyzed, knowledge graph is not the same as my datasets so far.

This subject has some other litreture not the same as what I discussed here but it is good to study and understand the idea good.

IDEA : that may help is to use softmax in my original work to make it better and work faster

This study has training and inference phase that worked well and performant


## Short conclusion
This article may not work well and can not give me a lot of information
